# HowdyVox Animated Face Feature

## Overview

The HowdyVox UI now includes an animated 8-bit face that reacts to the voice assistant's states in real-time. The face provides visual feedback during conversations, making the interaction more engaging and helping users understand what Howdy is doing at any given moment.

## Features

### State-Driven Animation

The face automatically changes its expression based on Howdy's current state:

- **Idle/Waiting**: Face blinks randomly every 3-6 seconds, mouth closed
- **Listening**: Eyes open wide, indicating active listening
- **Thinking**: Shows "..." dots animating above the face
- **Speaking**: Mouth animates in a cycle (closed → half → open → half) at ~10 Hz
- **Ending**: Returns to idle state

### Performance

- **Ultra-lightweight**: ~12 FPS during speaking, 6-8 FPS when idle
- **Minimal CPU overhead**: < 2-3% CPU usage on typical systems
- **No audio processing**: Face reacts to state changes only, not raw audio
- **Thread-safe**: All updates happen through the UI queue

## Architecture

### Components

1. **`face_animator.py`**: Core animation engine
   - `FaceAnimator` class manages all animation logic
   - State machine for different face expressions
   - Tkinter Canvas-based rendering
   - Configurable size and colors

2. **`ui_interface.py`**: Integration with main UI
   - Face widget positioned on left side of UI
   - Automatic state synchronization
   - Clean resource management

3. **`test_face_ui.py`**: Standalone test utility
   - Cycles through all face states
   - Useful for debugging animations
   - No voice assistant required

### State Machine

```
┌─────────┐
│  Idle   │ ←──┐
└────┬────┘    │
     │         │
     ↓         │
┌─────────┐   │
│Listening│   │
└────┬────┘   │
     │         │
     ↓         │
┌─────────┐   │
│Thinking │   │
└────┬────┘   │
     │         │
     ↓         │
┌─────────┐   │
│Speaking │ ──┘
└─────────┘
```

## Usage

### Running with the Animated Face

Simply launch the UI normally:

```bash
python launch_howdy_ui.py
```

The face will automatically appear on the left side of the UI window and start animating based on Howdy's state.

### Testing the Face Animations

To test the face animations without running the full voice assistant:

```bash
python test_face_ui.py
```

This will cycle through all face states automatically, allowing you to verify that animations are working correctly.

### Standalone Face Testing

You can also test the face animator directly:

```bash
python face_animator.py
```

This opens a small window with the animated face and control buttons to manually switch between states.

## Customization

### Changing Face Size

Edit `ui_interface.py` and modify the `FaceAnimator` initialization:

```python
# Default: 160x160 pixels
self.face_animator = FaceAnimator(self.face_canvas, size=160)

# Larger face: 240x240 pixels
self.face_animator = FaceAnimator(self.face_canvas, size=240)
```

### Modifying Colors

Edit `face_animator.py` and change the color palette in the `FaceAnimator.__init__` method:

```python
self.colors = {
    'bg': '#101010',           # Background color
    'head': '#F6DEB4',         # Skin tone
    'outline': '#000000',      # Black outlines
    'eye': '#000000',          # Eye color
    'mouth': '#000000',        # Mouth color
    'thinking': '#FFD700'      # Thinking dots color
}
```

### Adjusting Animation Speed

Modify the FPS settings in `face_animator.py`, `_animate()` method:

```python
if self.state == 'speaking':
    fps = 12  # Speaking animation speed (default: 12)
elif self.state == 'thinking':
    fps = 4   # Thinking animation speed (default: 4)
else:
    fps = 6   # Idle animation speed (default: 6)
```

## Technical Details

### Animation Loop

The face uses tkinter's `after()` method for animation timing:

1. Each frame is drawn based on current state
2. Animation counters are updated (mouth phase, thinking phase, etc.)
3. Blink timing is checked and applied
4. Next frame is scheduled based on state-specific FPS

### Resource Management

- Canvas items are redrawn each frame (no persistent objects)
- Animation loop is properly cancelled on cleanup
- Thread-safe state updates through the UI queue
- Minimal memory allocation per frame

### Integration Points

The face state is updated in `ui_interface.py:update_status()`:

```python
def update_status(self, status):
    # ... existing status indicator code ...

    # Update face animation state
    if self.face_animator:
        face_state_map = {
            'waiting': 'idle',
            'listening': 'listening',
            'processing': 'thinking',
            'thinking': 'thinking',
            'speaking': 'speaking',
            'ending': 'idle',
            'error': 'idle'
        }
        face_state = face_state_map.get(status, 'idle')
        self.face_animator.set_state(face_state)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Face Not Animating

1. Verify `face_animator.py` is in the same directory as `ui_interface.py`
2. Check that the face animator is started: `self.face_animator.start()` in `__init__`
3. Ensure no exceptions in the animation loop (check terminal output)

### Face Appears Frozen

- The animation loop may have stopped
- Try restarting the UI: `python launch_howdy_ui.py`
- Check system performance (high CPU usage may slow animations)

### Face Size Issues

- Adjust the canvas size in `ui_interface.py:create_widgets()`
- Modify the `size` parameter when creating `FaceAnimator`
- Ensure canvas dimensions match the face size

### Performance Issues

If you notice high CPU usage:

1. Reduce FPS in `face_animator.py` (lower the fps values)
2. Simplify the drawing logic (fewer shapes/calculations)
3. Increase the animation delay (lower frame rate)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not yet implemented):

- **Expression variations**: Happy, sad, confused faces
- **Eye tracking**: Eyes follow mouse cursor
- **Lip sync**: More sophisticated mouth shapes based on phonemes
- **Customizable themes**: Multiple face styles (robot, cartoon, realistic)
- **Accessibility**: High contrast mode, screen reader descriptions

## Implementation Notes

This implementation was based on the [HowdyVox Animated Face Spec](Research/HOWDYVox_Animated_Face_Spec.md), adapted from the original Pygame/UDP microservice design to a tkinter-integrated solution for seamless UI experience.

**Design decisions:**
- Chose tkinter Canvas over Pygame for easier integration with existing UI
- State-based animation instead of per-sample audio analysis for minimal overhead
- Direct integration instead of separate microservice for simplified deployment
- 8-bit aesthetic matches HowdyVox's friendly, approachable personality
