We're going to put this system through its paces to make sure that the first chunk plays smoothly without any stuttering or audio artifacts. The goal is to ensure that when the TTS system starts generating chunks in the background, the first chunk has enough time to be properly prepared before playback begins. This should eliminate the stuttering issue that was occurring when chunk number one tried to play before the system had fully stabilized. The new adaptive buffering system should handle even longer texts like this one with improved chunk sizing and pre-buffering strategies. Let's see how this performs with the enhanced timing mechanisms and whether we can maintain smooth audio playback throughout the entire sequence!",

We need to ensure that even with very long responses, like the kind you might get from a detailed explanation or a comprehensive answer to a complex question, the system maintains its stability and audio quality. The enhanced TTS implementation should handle multiple chunks seamlessly, with proper timing between each segment to prevent any stuttering, gaps, or audio artifacts that could disrupt the user experience. This test will verify that our pre-buffering strategies, adaptive delays, and queue management systems all work together harmoniously to deliver smooth, professional-quality text-to-speech output regardless of the input length. The system should demonstrate consistent performance across various text complexities while maintaining optimal resource usage and minimizing any potential latency issues that could affect real-time conversation flow.",
